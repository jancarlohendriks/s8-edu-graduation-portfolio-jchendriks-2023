# Prototype Evaluation For Adidas Sporty Tryouts

In this document I explain the evaluation I prepared for my concept, the Adidas Sporty Tryouts. The concept involves a short video game embedded on the e-commerce website of Adidas that allows customers to virtually try out different clothing items in various scenarios with their selected Adidas virtual ambassador, providing an interactive and engaging experience. Each clothing section comes with specific game scenarios such as football, basketball or tennis. The game provides users with rewards after finishing a game, increasing engagement and satisfaction. For testing purposes, this prototype will only demonstrate the game scenario of football, given the other game scenarios will follow the same structure of the application.

## Conclusion

In general, participants had a positive reaction to the avatar selection process, expressing enjoyment in trying on outfits and engaging with a mini game that enhanced their experience. The rewards offered were well-received, reflecting their appeal. While sharing avatars on social media was less favoured, overall satisfaction with the application was evident, leading to a willingness among participants to recommend it to others. Notably, the 3D clothing interaction and appealing rewards were highlights, though suggestions for improvement include enhancing product quality and increasing the game's level of challenge. Overall, the desirability of the application has been validated through this test, as well as the results that show the usability of the application is good.

## Recommendation

As described before, the quality of the application could improve, which is notable given that volumetric capture was made with other techniques than intended. It is therefore advisable to run the test again with a high end volumetric capture, including an improved version of the prototype. This new prototype should include an improved version of the game with more 3D elements and a dynamic environment to make it more challenging. It was also noted by my assessors that the navigation could be shortened, specially in the avatar selection, this could be implemented in a new iteration.
