## Conclusion

Volumetric capture has evolved from its roots in the entertainment sector to find applications in various industries such as retail and marketing campaigns. This indicates that the technology is not just a future prospect but is already delivering tangible business outcomes, including brand recognition, awareness, reputation, customer engagement, and data collection. Beyond these benefits, volumetric capture offers heightened immersiveness, attention-grabbing content, memorable experiences, and the ability to fully capture and reuse scenes, accelerating 3D asset creation. As a result, volumetric capture is poised to revolutionise the ecommerce experience, transform social media, enhance augmented reality, and contribute to the development of the metaverse.

Moreover, in the context of the surge in immersive technologies, volumetric capture plays a crucial role in making immersive experiences a part of everyday life. Advancements like Apple's Vision Pro and the AR Cloud, which create digital clones of the real world, will further blur the lines between imagination and reality, allowing brands to reach customers at unprecedented levels with techniques once confined to fiction movies and futuristic video games.

Those brands that embrace these technologies early on stand to gain a significant advantage by capturing the attention and awe of audiences. Volumetric capture also serves as a utilitarian tool for brands, helping customers make informed purchasing decisions, addressing issues like indecision and avoiding incorrect purchases. In the short term, brands can leverage these utilitarian goals, while in the long run, they can develop innovative and inspiring campaigns to amaze their audience.

## Recommendations

Investing in volumetric capture technology would give GroupM and its clients a competitive edge, as many brands have already started utilising this technology. By harnessing the numerous benefits of volumetric capture, GroupM's clients would have the opportunity to surprise their customers and establish themselves as authorities in innovation. Brands that already have an innovative reputation can elevate their positioning to the next level by incorporating volumetric capture. By guiding its clients into this new digital era, GroupM can position itself as an innovative and dependable partner that embraces future trends, serving as a valuable bridge to this future for its clients.

In the short term, it is advisable for retail brands, including fashion or apparel, cosmetics, and furniture industries, to explore practical applications of volumetric capture. As the competition has already begun, brands can still achieve the "wow" effect while volumetric capture remains relatively less mainstream.

In the medium term, brands can consider digital campaigns that blend the digital and physical realms, fostering high engagement and brand recognition. Social media platforms, particularly popular among younger audiences, provide an ideal avenue to showcase these innovative experiences and captivate audiences eagerly awaiting new technologies.

Looking to the long term, when the short and medium-term practices have become commonplace and XR technologies have become as ubiquitous as smartphones are today, brands can take marketing to the next level by turning science fiction into reality. Utilising the capabilities of the AR Cloud and merging the real world with digital and interactive interfaces, brands can create unprecedented experiences that blur the boundaries between reality and imagination.

Finally, it is advice for GroupM to take into consideration the desired outcomes for every campaign, aligning it with the technology at choice, as I have previously explored with my prototypes using different kinds of volumetric capture techniques such as High-End Capture, Sensor-based Capture, and Mobile-based Capture. These techniques can complement each other in producing immersive environments. Furthermore, GroupM should also take into consideration the limitations of technologies such VR headsets, given the need for physical wearability and potential discomfort can limit widespread usage.
