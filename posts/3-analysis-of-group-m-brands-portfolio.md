# Analysis of GroupM brands portfolio

The goal of this research is to identify the most significant industries within GroupM's portfolio and align their needs with the capabilities of volumetric capture, conducting research to understand the challenges faced by brands and customers in each industry and explore how volumetric capture can provide value in addressing these challenges.

## Research strategy

## Conclusion

After sharing my results with the main stakeholder, my company coach, it was agreed to narrow the focus to an individual brand in the apparel industry. Given the stakeholderâ€™s experience with these industries, it was decided to focus on Adidas, IKEA and to change Booking to Transavia given the broader application the travel industry has to offer.

My analysis has concluded that potential clients for my project find themselves in the apparel, furniture and hospitality industries. These industries are currently facing different challenges, such as low confidence in apparel items translating into higher returns which lowers customer satisfaction and means high expenses for companies in the apparel and furniture industries, as well as a high demand for personalisation in the hospitality industry.

## Recommendations

Now that it is clear which industries and more specifically which brands are the most appropriate to work with volumetric capture, the ideation phase can start. A systematic approach of creating ideas and filtering those ideas is recommended, this can be done using a morphological chart and the COCD-box.
