# A Comprehensive Guide to Utilising Volumetric Capture

The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive understanding of volumetric capture technology and its potential as an innovative solution for GroupM, providing a competitive advantage. Researching and analysing different types of volumetric capture, assess their advantages and limitations, and identify real-world case studies showcasing practical applications. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for generating ideas and developing a concept that can unlock new possibilities and offer distinctive solutions to GroupM's clients.

## Conclusion

By analysing the technology, its capabilities and its types, I have found that this technology is quite relevant, and it is also predicted to become even more so as it is only being improved over time.

Volumetric capture offers a unique feature which is to bring real life subjects to the digital space. These volumetric assets can be viewed from any angle in a Web3D environment, augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) and more, offering a highly realistic, immersive, and interactive 3D experience. Volumetric images and holograms combine the visual quality of traditional images with the unique immersion achieved through spatialized content.

Capture a person once and that video can be used in many different ways. The person can be scaled, duplicated, and even transformed since they are a digital capture of their real selves. At its core, volumetric video offers viewers a more immersive experience

The possibilities are endless, and there is serious money involved. By 2026, the volumetric video market is expected to approach the $5 billion mark (Arcturus, 2022), and those are likely conservative estimates.

All and all, choosing the appropriate technique for using volumetric capture depends on its intended use and depends on the user to analyse the cost effectiveness required. Mobile devices and high end capture might be two of the most common appropriate solutions, as they could be easily combined. High-end techniques provide overall the best quality and versatility for production.

## Recommendations

Based on my knowledge, volumetric capture represents not only the next generation of 3D asset generation, but also a transformative force in our interaction with digital worlds. It is imperative to take it seriously and closely monitor its further developments. With the imminent rise of Extended Reality technologies like VR, AR, and the Metaverse, volumetric capture will assume a progressively significant role. While a standardised approach is yet to be solidified, media companies such as GroupM can gain considerable advantages by being pioneers in exploring the possibilities offered by this technology. Therefore, investing in its own high-quality volumetric capture studio would yield long-term value, as it enables the creation of versatile and production-ready digital assets.
