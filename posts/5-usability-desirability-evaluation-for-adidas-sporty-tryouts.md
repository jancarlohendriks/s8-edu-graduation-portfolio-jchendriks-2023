title: Usability And Desirability Evaluation For Adidas Sporty Tryouts
---

In this document I explain the usability and the desirability evaluation I planned and its execution for my concept, the Adidas Sporty Tryouts. The concept involves a short video game embedded on the e-commerce website of Adidas that allows customers to virtually try out different clothing items in various scenarios with their selected Adidas virtual ambassador, providing an interactive and engaging experience. Each clothing section comes with specific game scenarios such as football, basketball or tennis. The game provides users with rewards after finishing a game, increasing engagement and satisfaction. Conducting this usability and desirability test early in the concept development process is important because it validates the user needs and preferences, reducing the risk of investing in a product that may not meet market expectations. Furthermore, by iterating and refining the concept based on user feedback, I can create a more user-centric and competitive product, this aligns with the principles of user-centred design. This approach not only enhances user satisfaction but also leads to potential cost savings by addressing issues before they become expensive to rectify. For testing purposes, this prototype will only demonstrate the game scenario of football, given the other game scenarios will follow the same structure of the application.

## Conclusion

In general, participants had a positive reaction to the avatar selection process, expressing enjoyment in trying on outfits (60% most liked action) and engaging with a mini game that enhanced their experience (60% enhanced shopping experience by game). The rewards offered were well-received (80% improved experience by rewards), reflecting their appeal. While sharing avatars on social media was less favoured, overall satisfaction with the application was evident (72% in satisfaction), leading to a willingness among participants to recommend it to others (76% willing to share). Notably, the 3D clothing interaction and appealing rewards were highlights, though suggestions for improvement include enhancing product quality and increasing the game's level of challenge. Overall, the desirability of the application has been validated through this test given the positive feedback, as well as the results that show the usability of the application is good (all features scored 100% in task success).

## Recommendation

As described before, the quality of the application could improve, which is notable given that volumetric capture was made with other techniques than intended. It is therefore advisable to run the test again with a high end volumetric capture, including an improved version of the prototype. This new prototype should include an improved version of the game with more 3D elements and a dynamic environment to make it more challenging. It was also noted by my assessors that the navigation could be shortened, specially in the avatar selection, this could be implemented in a new iteration.

The validation of the application's conversion rate remains a critical task. Before committing to any final investments and implementation, it's imperative to assess the application's conversion rate to validate the underlying concept and mitigate financial risks. To achieve this, another evaluation is necessary, one that incorporates quantitative data illustrating user interactions with the application. While methods such as preference tests or surveys can help us understand user preferences and emotional responses to design, they often fall short in providing actionable insights. Furthermore, users' perceptions don't always align with their actual behaviour, introducing the potential for response bias.

I recommend employing the A/B test method, as it not only offers a more comprehensive perspective but also yields quantifiable performance metrics based on real user interactions. This data-driven approach is essential for assessing the concept's effectiveness and its potential to significantly boost sales for Adidas. To conduct this quantitative test effectively, it is necessary to establish a test period, define the conditions necessary for concept validation, and select the appropriate tools.
