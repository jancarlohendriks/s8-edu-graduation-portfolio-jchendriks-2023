# Research Phase

During this phase, I started to empathise with volumetric capture and gained a comprehensive understanding of the technology, its offerings, relevance, working principles, while testing and comparing different techniques myself to accomplish a volumetric capture, such as mobile based, sensor based, and high end, uncovering different degrees of quality output and providing advice on the selection of the technique. In short, volumetric capture technology is a relevant and rapidly evolving field with the potential for immersive experiences, economic growth, and various creative applications. The appropriate technique for capturing volumetric content depends on the intended use and cost-effectiveness considerations. To find more, read my <a href="../docs/a-comprehensive-guide-to-utilising-volumetric-capture.pdf" target="_blank">A Comprehensive Guide to Utilising Volumetric Capture</a>.

To narrow my research of volumetric capture specifically to the use of this project’s context and GroupM, I explored precedent and potential use cases of volumetric capture for brands, highlighting its benefits and providing real case examples in different industries. I also considered future prospects beyond volumetric capture and its role within the immersive technologies landscape. As a result, in my findings I uncovered that brands that embrace these technologies early on stand to gain a significant advantage by capturing the attention and awe of audiences. Volumetric capture also serves as a utilitarian tool for brands. In the short term, brands can leverage these utilitarian goals, while in the long run, they can develop innovative and inspiring campaigns to amaze their audience. My findings can be seen in my document <a href="../docs/potential-of-volumetric-capture-for-brands.pdf" target="_blank">Potential of Volumetric Capture for Brands</a>.

Finally, to find potential applications of volumetric capture for my project, I decided to analyse GroupM’s portfolio of clients. I received a document from the company summarising all of the brands, for which I categorised and filtered all of the industries using the information collected in my previous studies as well. Based on the results I concluded that brands of GroupM in the industries of apparel, cosmetics, furniture, travel and hospitality had the most potential to find a solution with volumetric capture. From there, I analysed and compared the individual brands under each of these industries, in order to find the most suitable clients. The brands that got selected are Adidas, IKEA and Transavia. The results of this research can be found in my <a href="../docs/analysis-of-groupm-brands-portfolio.pdf" target="_blank">Analysis of GroupM brands portfolio</a>. This research would serve as the foundation for starting with the Concept phase.

# Concept Phase

During this phase, and given I narrowed down the scope of my research to only 3 brands, I proceeded to generate ideas for each of them. I decided to take a systematic approach because this would help me generate the most ideas, but also select the most appropriate. For this, I used a morphological chart, typically used in product design, which is particularly useful to come up with unexpected alternatives for complex designs. For filtering the ideas, I decided to use the COCD-box method to converge brainstorming ideas, which uses two criteria, namely originality and feasibility. I ended up selecting 1 idea for each brand, and worked them out in 3 different concept books. These concept books are <a href="../docs/concept-for-adidas.pdf" target="_blank">Adidas Sporty Tryouts</a>, <a href="../docs/concept-for-ikea.pdf" target="_blank">IKEA Personal Assistant</a> and <a href="../docs/concept-for-transavia.pdf" target="_blank">Transavia's Virtual Travel Companion</a>.

In addition, as part of my deliverables, I summarised all of my findings and created a presentation, called <a href="../docs/volumetric-capture-for-media-planners.pdf" target="_blank">Volumetric Capture For Media planners</a>, and it’s targeted towards GroupM’s media planners. This presentation summarises all of my findings in the previous phase, and adds recommendations for effective volumetric capture usage, best practices for maximising impact and tips for integrating volumetric capture into media planning workflows, as well as including my concept ideas. This document will serve media planners as a tool to understand the technology and apply it to their offerings at the moment of dealing with clients. The format of the document makes it easy to share among media planners and eventually clients. The results of the ideation phase can be found in my <a href="../docs/ideas-generation-selection.pdf" target="_blank">Ideas Generation & Selection</a> document.

To continue with the project, and after discussing with my stakeholder, I decided to continue with the Adidas Sporty Tryouts concept. As I found in my initial research and current examples of the volumetric capture being used by brands, it is evident that immersive technology, including volumetric capture is rapidly evolving in the apparel industry, and I found that GroupM can step up in that stage to sharpen its competitive edge.

# Prototype Phase

In this phase, I focused on bringing the Adidas Sporty Tryouts to life. First, by creating a <a href="../docs/adidas-try-out-flowchart.pdf" target="_blank">User Flow</a> to help me illustrate how the application would function. To test the feasibility of building this application, I created a <a href="https://jancarlohendriks.github.io/s8-edu-volu-web/#left" target="_blank">VolCap POC</a>, where I let a participant be captured in motion portraying different actions necessary for the features of my concept. I did so by using an alternative technique, namely Volograms, given the actual volumetric capture room of GroupM was not yet available during my project. The alternative provided a reliable way of obtaining similar results as a high end volumetric capture room, given it provides a moving 3D scene that I can use in my project.

Furthermore, I created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/eNkAxAEtnZJ1NrCkgHkP0u/Prototype?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=RnWVQjfyUowQjZ3s-0" target="_blank">Clickable Prototype</a> of the application where the user flow is translated into a design. I tested the prototype on its usability and validated the concept and experience with the intended target audience, young athletes and sport enthusiasts. Overall, the target audience responded really positively about the application, feeling confident with the avatar selection process, trying the outfits in the virtual wardrobe, and having an improved shopping experience by receiving rewards after playing a game. Although, the mini game could be improved by making it more dynamic, as well as the quality of the rendered 3D scene. These shortcomings can be tackled by investing more resources in using high end volumetric captures and applying more gamification techniques. The results can be found in my <a href="../docs/prototype-evaluation-for-adidas-sporty-tryouts.pdf" target="_blank">Prototype Evaluation For Adidas Sporty Tryouts</a>.

# Conclusion

Volumetric capture technology is a relevant and rapidly evolving field with the potential for immersive experiences, economic growth, and various creative applications. The appropriate technique for capturing volumetric content depends on the intended use and cost-effectiveness considerations. Brands that embrace these technologies early on stand to gain a significant advantage by capturing the attention and awe of audiences. Volumetric capture also serves as a utilitarian tool for brands, aiding in providing virtual try-ons, product demonstrations, educational content, interactive storytelling, helping customers make informed purchasing decisions and addressing issues like indecision and avoiding incorrect purchases.

Among the various industries within GroupM portfolio, and as my research has shown, the apparel, furniture, hospitality and travel industries pose to be the best candidates for applications of volumetric capture. These industries can make use of the benefits this technology has to offer by merging digital experiences into the real world with an outstanding level of realism helping their clients in making a more confident decision. Media planners can learn more about and incorporate this innovative technology into their campaigns using the presentation I prepared. The concept books that I created are examples that can be further explored and tested. To apply volumetric capture in campaigns, media planners need to consider the demands of storing and streaming volumetric data, challenges in achieving realism and quality especially for dynamic subjects, ensuring a smooth user experience across different hardware and connectivity, leveraging volumetric capabilities for engaging storytelling, and evaluating the overall costs and ROI before integrating volumetric capture into their campaigns. To tackle this, media planners should establish clear objectives that align with the technology's immersive potential and audience engagement, collaborate closely with experts, allocate a suitable budget and choose content that benefits from the technology's immersive aspects.

Regarding the Adidas Sporty Tryouts concept, the target audience responded really positively about the application, feeling confident with the avatar selection process, trying the outfits in the virtual wardrobe, and having an improved shopping experience by receiving rewards after playing a game. Although, the mini game could be improved by making it more dynamic, as well as the quality of the rendered 3D scene. These shortcomings can be tackled by investing more resources in using high end volumetric captures, incorporating more 3D assets into the game and applying more gamification techniques to make the game more appealing.

To summarise, my report Volumetric Capture For Media Planners, my concepts and the Adidas Sporty Tryouts POC form a strong foundation to understand and incorporate volumetric capture in media campaigns, demonstrating the multiple applications this technology has for brands of GroupM. Nevertheless, considerations regarding the appropriate technique need to be taken, as well as its suitability within a campaign.

# Reflection

This internship has helped me in expanding my horizons, stepping out of my comfort zone of web development and exploring new and innovative technologies, mainly immersive technologies where I have always been intrigued by, while doing so I also sharpened my research skills, by using systematic approaches and setting criteria for making and justifying my conclusions and decisions. Gathering the results of my learnings and translating those into research papers contributed to my growth and confidence as an IT professional.

Previously having worked in smaller digital agencies, I was curious to explore how a big organisation works. The first half of the internship presented a challenge since I had to adapt to a faster pace of working. But in the second half I managed to make improvements in my pace and deliveries, learning from previous sprints and setting targets for every week, adapting to a new style of work. In addition, working in a media company also provided me with new insights regarding the building of a campaign and the intricate process involved.

Another challenge was the absence of the technology at hand, the high end volumetric capture room, for which no release date was known. I tackled this uncertainty by exploring and testing alternatives and using the knowledge I gained to apply in my project. This proved to be an effective strategy.

Volumetric capture is still on the rise and not known to the general public, but I can see its imminent potential together with other emerging technologies such as Mixed Reality devices and the AR Cloud, the Augmented Reality version of the Metaverse. I am very happy to have had the opportunity to work on this technology and I am also proud to have brought valuable insights and applicable applications to GroupM, expanding its competitive edge.

Working on this project has also sparked my motivation to continue seeking projects where innovation is forged, pushing my boundaries even further.

Lastly, I would like to thank Charlie for providing me really valuable feedback throughout the internship, as well as Eric for pushing me in improving my skills as a researcher, and both for helping me in my journey of becoming a better professional.
