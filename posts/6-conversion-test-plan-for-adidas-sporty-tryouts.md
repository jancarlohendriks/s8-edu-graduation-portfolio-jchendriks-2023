title: Conversion Test Plan For Adidas Sporty Tryouts
---

In this document, I will explain my test plan for demonstrating the conversion rate of my concept, Adidas Sporty Tryouts. This concept involves embedding a short video game on the Adidas e-commerce website, allowing customers to virtually try out different clothing items in various scenarios with their selected Adidas virtual ambassador. This interactive and engaging experience offers users rewards after finishing a game, aiming to increase engagement and satisfaction. Each clothing section is paired with specific game scenarios, such as football, basketball, or tennis. Before proceeding to production, it's essential to validate the commercial value of this concept by demonstrating its conversion rate. Assessing the application's conversion rate is highly significant prior to committing to any definitive investment and execution. This evaluation helps confirm the viability of the idea and reduces potential financial risks. Before reaching this point, I've already conducted a test regarding usability and user desirability, which have shown that users find it easy to use, enjoyable, and are willing to share it with others. This positive feedback reinforces the concept's potential.

## Conclusion

This document outlines a specific objective: to showcase the conversion rate increase in sales for Adidas. To achieve this, I've chosen to conduct an A/B test, as it provides quantifiable performance metrics derived from real user interactions. This approach is favoured over preference tests or surveys, which primarily focus on user preferences and emotional responses to design, taking into consideration that user perceptions may not consistently align with their actual behaviour, potentially introducing response bias into the results.

There are various tools available for conducting this test, but I recommend utilising Optimizely. This choice is based on the fact that it's already in use by the Adidas team and offers comprehensive developer documentation.

## Recommendation

The recommended period for running this test is one month, but the product-development cycles of the Adidas team should be taken into consideration in order to align the time period accordingly, reason being that the conclusions are not influenced by other factors such as other changes in the product.

I will contribute to the development team by providing a prototype that integrates the new virtual wardrobe feature into the product page. This prototype will serve as a valuable resource for the Adidas development team, enabling them to seamlessly incorporate the new feature and ensure the successful execution of the test. GroupM can then reach out to the Adidas development team to include this prototype in the A/B test, allowing for an analysis of the conversion rate. This data will enable GroupM to validate the conversion performance of Adidas Sporty Tryouts, ultimately leading to a decision on whether to implement this concept.
